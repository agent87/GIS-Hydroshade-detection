The implimentaton of the function is:
1)We shall anylyse the pixel data for indiviual water pixel.
2)After we shall enclose a full body depicting the water bodies
3)we shall determine the highest accumulation point to determine the direction main vector.
4)From the flow accumulation, now we can now trace the individual water pixel to the highest water accumulation point.

Let's get our hands dirty!!!
